Hi there! My name is Jaber and I'm currently doing this project as part of my Frontend career path via Scrimba.

This project involves building a tool that can generate two random passwords when a user clicks a button. The tool is built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components to create a functional and visually appealing password generator. Passwords generated by the tool must be 15 characters long.

Thanks!
